### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://burnlees.github.io/social-links-profile/](https://burnlees.github.io/social-links-profile/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I gained more experience with styling links, creating them into button-esque elements. Providing them with different stylings for different states.

```
ul.social-links li a:hover,
a:active {
  background-color: var(--clr-primary-grn);
  color: var(--clr-neutral-off-blk);
}
```

I tried to put into practise some of the feedback i recieved from the previous challenge, including using min-height rather than just height on the body element, and some slightly more semantic HTML.

I also used chrome's DevTools to my advantage with this challenge, was helpful being able to see the different elements and how they interact when live.
